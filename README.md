# sandbox-doom

this is a mod for entertainment purposes
it has
14 monster modes to choose from
10 patrolpoint markers where monsters can walk to
traps you can unleash 
level warping to any level
pretty much chaos that you unleash yourself lol

to start adding anything visit menudef.txt to

all u need to do is compress everything into a single
file and load it with gzdoom enjoy :)
